# Genetic-algorithm
Removed timetable clashes using genetic algorithm.
Introduction:
The Project was based on the genetic algorithm to search for a timetable 
that has least number of conflicts. The conflicts implemented are:
* No teacher can hold two classes at the same time
* No section can listen for two classes at the same time
* No classroom can receive two classes at the same time
* No teacher can hold three consecutive classes
* There will be no class before 8:30 am and after 5:00 pm.
* University will remain close as there will be no class on weekends (Sat, 
Sun)
### The generated timetable is represented in the form of Day, Slot, Lecture, Batch
and Room.
